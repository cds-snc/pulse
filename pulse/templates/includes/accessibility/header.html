       The US Government’s mission is to serve the needs of all its citizens, including the approximately 60 million who live with disabilities. For websites, this means that pages should be built according to certain standards that ensure, for example, that a visually impaired user accessing a government site through a screen reader will be able to navigate and access the same information available to a non-visually-impaired user.

      The Accessibility Report measures adherence to best practices for implementing accessible websites in the federal government. We plan to post quarterly updates, and will eventually add additional measures to the dashboard to show our progress over time.

      IMPORTANT:  The Pulse reports <strong><u>do not</u> constitute a complete evaluation of compliance with accessibility requirements</strong>. Rather, they display the results of limited automated scans that address only a small portion of what’s required to make a website fully accessible. In addition, although significant effort has been taken to ensure accuracy, Pulse may occasionally cite findings that, through additional manual testing, are found to be false positives. Due to limitations of automated testing, the Pulse checks are not intended to be authoritative, and are not intended to convey a Section 508 conformance assessment.
